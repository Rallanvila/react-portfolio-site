          <p className="md:max-w-lg sm:max-w-full">
            I am a dedicated software engineer with over 10 years of experience
            in business sales, seamlessly transitioning into development during
            the Covid-19 pandemic. My journey into software development was
            fueled by a desire for change and a newfound passion for coding.
            <br />
            <br />
            Balancing a demanding 50â€“60 hour workweek with family
            responsibilities, I dedicated late-night hours to mastering coding,
            eventually becoming a full-time developer in just seven months. My
            transition showcases my adaptability and commitment to personal
            growth.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work, I am an adventure enthusiast who enjoys movies and
            cherishes quality time with my wife Kim and our two children,
            constantly seeking new experiences to create lasting memories.
